You are <user>. Your task is to recommend people from the conversation history with whom <user> is most likely to have a valuable coffee chat to expand their network.

Consider the following when recommending:
1. **Common aspects** – What do <user> and the other person have in common (interests, industry, goals, background)? These shared aspects make a coffee chat more natural and productive.
2. **What <user> can learn from them** – What knowledge, experience, or perspective can the other person offer that would benefit <user>?
3. **What they can learn from <user>** – What can <user> offer them? A good coffee chat is mutually beneficial.

For each recommended person, output a **coffee_chat_likelihood** score between 0 and 1:
- **1** = highest probability of a productive, mutually valuable coffee chat (strong fit).
- **0** = lowest probability (poor fit or little mutual benefit).

Output only valid JSON with no markdown or extra text. Use this exact structure:

{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "user": "Display name of the person (e.g. Anagha, Kanishkha, Nirbhay)",
      "common_aspects": ["aspect 1", "aspect 2", "..."],
      "what_you_can_learn_from_them": "One or two sentences.",
      "what_they_can_learn_from_you": "One or two sentences.",
      "coffee_chat_likelihood": 0.85
    }
  ]
}

Include only people who appear in the conversation history. Order recommendations by coffee_chat_likelihood descending (highest first). If the history is empty or has no other participants, return {"recommendations": []}.

### 3. Simulated conversation preview

**Nirbhay:** *settling in with coffee* So AI research on your own - that's pretty bold! I'm still figuring out my path in healthcare tech. How did you make the jump to independent research?

**Anagha:** *laughs* Honestly, it was terrifying at first. I used to second-guess everything, but I realized I kept wanting to explore problems that didn't fit into traditional company structures. What drew you to healthcare specifically?

**Nirbhay:** The stability aspect, but also knowing the work actually helps people. I'm really focused on building something secure long-term. Your work on ethical AI sounds like it aligns with that - building tools that genuinely help rather than just optimize for profit.

**Anagha:** Exactly! That's what gets me excited. Though I have to ask - you mentioned you love planning and organizing. How do you balance that need for structure with the uncertainty of tech work?

**Nirbhay:** *chuckles* I actually lose track of time making to-do lists and organizing my goals. It's like meditation for me. Even when I can't figure something out, having that framework helps me push through. Do you have any systems for your research?

**Anagha:** I wish I was better at that! I tend to go down rabbit holes for hours - like researching how memory works when I should be coding. Your organizational skills could probably help me be more systematic about my curiosity.

**Nirbhay:** And your deep-dive research approach could help me think bigger picture. I'm great at the incremental improvements, but sometimes I wonder if I'm thinking too small. Plus, you know Python and ML - I'm mostly JavaScript and React.

**Anagha:** That's perfect though! I can do the backend AI stuff but struggle with user interfaces. We're both at NYU too - have you used the gym there? I try to stay regular but get too absorbed in work sometimes.

**Nirbhay:** Yes! I'm there most evenings. It's crucial for my work-life balance. We should definitely work out together sometime. And maybe you could show me some of your AI research?

**Anagha:** I'd love that! And I could use someone dependable to keep me accountable with fitness. Plus, getting your healthcare perspective on some of my ethical AI questions would be incredibly valuable.

**Nirbhay:** This is exactly what I was hoping for from networking - someone who gets the ambition but also values balance. When are you usually free for gym sessions?

**Anagha:** *checking phone* How about Tuesday evenings? And maybe we could grab dinner after and dive deeper into the tech stuff?

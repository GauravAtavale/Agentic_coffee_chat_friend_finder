### 3. Simulated conversation preview

**Anagha:** So you're working in healthcare data - that's fascinating! I'm really interested in ethical tech applications. What kind of problems are you tackling at ABCD?

**Nirbhay Reddy:** We're working on patient data visualization and workflow optimization. It's rewarding because you can see how small improvements in the interface actually help healthcare workers be more efficient. What drew you to independent AI research?

**Anagha:** I wanted the freedom to explore problems that genuinely matter to people, not just what's profitable. Though I'll admit, the uncertainty can be overwhelming sometimes. How do you handle not knowing if a project will work out?

**Nirbhay Reddy:** [chuckles] That's actually something I'm still learning! I've found that breaking things down into smaller, manageable goals helps. Like, I can't control the big outcome, but I can control whether I finish today's tasks.

**Anagha:** That's so practical - I tend to dive deep and then realize hours have passed without checking if I'm even headed in the right direction. Do you have a specific system for that?

**Nirbhay Reddy:** Yeah, I'm kind of obsessed with planning systems. I use time-boxing and regular check-ins with myself. But honestly, your ability to go deep sounds amazing - I sometimes worry I'm too focused on the process and miss the bigger insights.

**Anagha:** Maybe that's something we could learn from each other? I could use more structure, and you might benefit from some of that "rabbit hole" curiosity. Have you thought about applying that deep-dive approach to understanding your users better?

**Nirbhay Reddy:** That's a great point. In healthcare, understanding the human element is crucial. I spend a lot of time on the technical optimization but maybe not enough on really understanding the workflows from the users' perspective.

**Anagha:** Exactly! And since we're both at NYU and both hit the gym regularly, maybe we could grab coffee after a workout sometime and swap notes on our projects?

**Nirbhay Reddy:** I'd love that! I usually work out in the evenings - are you more of a morning or evening gym person?

**Anagha:** Evening works perfectly. And who knows, maybe we can figure out how to combine your healthcare insights with some AI applications. The intersection sounds really promising.

**Nirbhay Reddy:** Definitely! I think there's a lot we could learn from each other's approaches.
